        PHP Loops
    </h1>
    <p>
        Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.
    </p>
    <p>
        Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.

    </p>
    <p>
        In PHP, we have the following loop types:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true </li>
        <li> do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true </li>
        <li> for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times </li>
        <li> foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array </li>
        <li> The following chapters will explain and give examples of each loop type </li>
    </ul>
