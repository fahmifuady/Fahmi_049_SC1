    <h2>PHP Variables</h2>
    <p>A variable can have a short name $x and
        $y or a more descriptive name $age,
        $carname, $total_volume.</p>
    <p>Rules for PHP variables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable</li>
        <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
        <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
        <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
        <li>Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and
            $AGE are two different variables)
        </li>
    </ul>
